Aggregation

An example of aggregation is creating a pipeline stage as an array.
MongoDB requires that inside of the aggregate() method, our first argument is an array containing the pipeline stages we use.

db.<collection>.aggregate()

An example:
Consider the sample document:
{ 
  student_id: 94204,
  first_name: "Sun",
  last_name: "Ko",
  grade_level: 6,
  test_scores: [99, 97. 96, 99],
  average_test_score: 98.65
}

We can create an aggregate like so:

db.students.aggregate([
  {
    // First stage
    $match: {grade_level: 6, average_test_score: {$gt: 97}}
  },
  { 
    // Second Stage
    $sort: { first_name: 1} 
  },
  { 
    // Third Stage
    // There is a prefix with a $ to indicate it is a field path. Field paths are used to access a documentâ€™s fields inside of an expression
    $addFields:  {
      highest_score: { $max: "$test_scores" }  
    }
  },
  {
    // Fourth Stage, create a new collection using $out stage
    $out : "candidates"
  }
])
